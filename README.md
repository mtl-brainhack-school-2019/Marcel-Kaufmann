# ECG Pupillometry Pipeline
Brain Hack School 2019 Project by Marcel Kaufmann
---
# Summary

This Brain Hack project is to create a processing pipeline for ECG and pupillometry data. The motivation behind this task is that our lab is currently conducting a Human-Robot-Interaction user study in which we collect the following data:
* Pupillometry (Pupil Labs Eye Tracker)
* Heart rate and RR intervals (Polar 700 fitness tracker)
* ECG, EDA from Biopac (as acq files)
